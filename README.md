# Roper
> A Repo Manager For The Rest Of Us

Roper ~~is~~ (will be)  yum repo manager webservice with RESTful endpoints.  To goal of this is to provide the same functionality (and then some) that the `createrepo` primitive does (for the uninitiated, this is the program you use to create yum repos), as well as CRUD functionality for repos and RPMs.

This is a WIP and is a practice project for structuring applications.  Criticisms welcome for those with too much time on their hands.
